## kramdown2 1.13.0 released

The biggest change in this release is the introduction of a converter for [man pages]. Although
there already exist two solutions ([ronn] and [kramdown2-man]), both are not completely satisfactory:

* Ronn doesn't use standard Markdown syntax for all elements.
* kramdown2-man only converts a subset of the available element types.

The new man page converter uses standard kramdown2 syntax and supports nearly all element types,
including tables.

This release also brings some enhancements for the GFM parser. One thing to note is that the header
ID generation is now more compatible to GFM which also means that **some IDs will be different** -
so check the documents on which you use the GFM parser, especially when you are using Jekyll or
Github Pages.

Organizational-wise, issues and pull requests on Github that pertain to feature requests have been
closed and are now tracked through a dedicated [kramdown2 project on
Github](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown2/projects/1).
