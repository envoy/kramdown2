## kramdown2 1.3.2 released

This release brings some small performance optimizations and the ability to define custom rules for
updating predefined link definitions. The latter is used in [webgen](http://webgen.gettalong.org)
1.2.1 to drastically reduce the time for converting kramdown2 documents that use a lot of predefined
link definitions.


## Changes

* 2 minor changes:

  - Small (mostly string) performance optimizations
  - New method `Kramdown2::Parser::Kramdown2#update_link_definitions` method
