## Math Engine Mathjax-Node

This math engine was built-in until kramdown2 2.0 and since then is available through the
[`kramdown2-math-mathjaxnode` gem](https://github.com/kramdown2/math-mathjaxnode).

[Mathjax-Node](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-node) converts TeX math formulas into MathML and
can be used together with the [HTML converter](../converter/html.html).

See <https://github.com/kramdown2/math-mathjaxnode> for documentation!
