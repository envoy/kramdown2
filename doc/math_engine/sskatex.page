## Math Engine SsKaTeX

This math engine was built-in until kramdown2 2.0 and since then is available through the
[`kramdown2-math-sskatex` gem](https://github.com/kramdown2/math-sskatex).

This math engine uses a server-side installation of [KaTeX](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/) to
convert TeX math formulas into HTML+MathML. This eliminates the need for client-side math-rendering
Javascript. Consider this a flexible for-trusted-users-only alternative to the [KaTeX math
engine](katex.html) and a lightweight efficient alternative to [Mathjax-Node](mathjaxnode.html).

See <https://github.com/kramdown2/math-sskatex> for documentation!
